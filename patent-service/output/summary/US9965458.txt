A method for tokenizing text for natural language processing comprises: generating from a pool of documents , a set of statistical models comprising one or more entries each indicating a likelihood of appearance of a character / letter sequence in the pool of documents ; receiving a set of rules comprising rules that identify character / letter sequences as valid tokens ; transforming one or more entries in the statistical models into new rules that are added to the set of rules when the entries indicate a high likelihood ; receiving a document to be processed ; dividing the docu ment to be processed into tokens based on the set of statistical models and the set of rules , wherein the statistical models are applied where the rules fail to unambiguously tokenize the document ; and outputting the divided tokens for natural language processing.
