Today, we have Junlin Wang, a researcher from Duke University, who has been working on a new approach to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs). Junlin, welcome to the show! Can you tell us a bit about your research and what inspired you to work on this topic?'), LineItem(speaker='Guest', text='Thanks for having me, Jane! Our research focuses on developing a new framework called Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) that leverages the collective strengths of multiple LLMs to improve their performance. We were inspired by the idea that different models possess unique strengths and specialize in various tasks, and we wanted to explore ways to harness this diversity to create a more capable and robust model.'), LineItem(speaker='Host (Jane)', text="That's fascinating! Can you explain how MoA works and what makes it different from other approaches?"), LineItem(speaker='Guest', text='MoA is a layered architecture where each layer consists of multiple LLM agents. Each agent takes all the outputs from agents in the previous layer as auxiliary information in generating its response. This iterative refinement process continues for several cycles until obtaining a more robust and comprehensive response. What makes MoA unique is its ability to leverage the collaborativeness among LLMs, where models tend to generate better responses when presented with outputs from other models.'), LineItem(speaker='Host (Jane)', text="I see. So, MoA is like a team effort among different models, where each model builds upon the strengths of the others. That's really interesting. Can you tell us more about the concept of collaborativeness among LLMs and how it benefits MoA?"), LineItem(speaker='Guest', text='Yes, certainly. Our research has shown that LLMs exhibit collaborativeness, where models tend to generate better responses when presented with outputs from other models, even if those outputs are of lower quality. This phenomenon is widespread among LLMs, and MoA leverages this collaborativeness to improve the overall performance of the model.'), LineItem(speaker='Host (Jane)', text="That's really cool. And how does MoA compare to other approaches, such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and model ensemble methods?"), LineItem(speaker='Guest', text='MoA draws inspiration from MoE, but operates at the model level rather than at the activation level. MoA also differs from model ensemble methods, which typically involve reranking outputs from different models or training a router to predict the best-performing model. MoA instead uses a layered architecture to iteratively refine the responses, leveraging the strengths of multiple models.'), LineItem(speaker='Host (Jane)', text='I see. So, MoA is a more holistic approach that takes into account the strengths and weaknesses of multiple models. That makes sense. What are some potential applications of MoA, and how do you see it being used in the future?'), LineItem(speaker='Guest', text='MoA has the potential to improve the performance of LLMs in various natural language understanding and generation tasks. We envision MoA being used in applications such as chat assistants, language translation, and text summarization. Additionally, MoA could be used to improve the interpretability of models, as the intermediate outputs are expressed in natural language.'), LineItem(speaker='Host (Jane)', text="That's really exciting. And what are some of the limitations of MoA, and how do you plan to address them in future research?"), LineItem(speaker='Guest', text='One of the limitations of MoA is the high Time to First Token (TTFT), which can negatively impact user experience. To mitigate this issue, we plan to explore chunk-wise aggregation instead of aggregating entire responses at once, which can reduce TTFT while maintaining response quality.'), LineItem(speaker='Host (Jane)', text="I see. Well, Junlin, it's been great having you on the show. Can you tell us a bit more about your research team and what's next for you?"), LineItem(speaker='Guest', text="Thanks, Jane! Our research team is a collaboration between Duke University and Together AI, and we're excited to continue exploring the potential of MoA in various applications. We're also planning to release our code and models to the public, so stay tuned for that!"), LineItem(speaker='Host (Jane)', text="That's great to hear. Well, that's all the time we have for today. Thanks again, Junlin, for sharing your research with us. And to our listeners, thanks for tuning in.
